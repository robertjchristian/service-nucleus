                This project is meant to serve as a feature-rich starting point for enterprise and commercial web
                applications. It integrates Netflix-karyon and AngularJS with projects like Angular-UI, Angular-Strap, Bootstrap, and
                jQuery, along with examples of angular services, directives, controllers, and filters.  And adds aditional support for auditing, dynamic web services, and more.
